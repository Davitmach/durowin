            This Privacy Policy ("Policy") outlines the manner in which we collect, use, store, and protect your personal information when interacting with our online casino offered via the Telegram Mini App (the "App"). By accessing and using the App, you consent to the practices described below.<br/>
1. Collection and processing of personal data<br/>
<br/>
Upon launching the App via Telegram, we automatically receive and may process the following information provided through your Telegram profile:<br/>
<br/>
    Username<br/>
<br/>
    First name<br/>
<br/>
    Last name<br/>
<br/>
    Telegram ID (a unique user identifier)<br/>
<br/>
This data is utilized strictly for the purpose of user identification and to personalize and enhance your in-app experience.<br/>
2. Use of information<br/>
<br/>
Your data may be used for the following purposes:<br/>
<br/>
    Personalizing the interface and displaying your identity in the game<br/>
<br/>
    Saving and restoring your game progress<br/>
<br/>
    Ensuring security, fraud prevention, and protection from abuse<br/>
<br/>
    Improving service quality and conducting internal analytics (aggregated and anonymized)<br/>
<br/>
We do not share your personal data with third parties except when required by law or regulatory authorities.<br/>
3. Data protection<br/>
<br/>
We apply commercially reasonable technical and administrative measures to safeguard your data against unauthorized access, alteration, or destruction. However, no method of internet transmission is entirely secure, and by using the App, you acknowledge and accept the inherent risks.<br/>
4. Violations and enforcement<br/>
<br/>
Any form of tampering, reverse-engineering, exploiting bugs, using bots, automation tools, or any manipulation of the game mechanics is strictly prohibited.<br/>
<br/>
We reserve the right to suspend or permanently restrict user access and to freeze any associated in-game assets without prior notice in the event of such violations.<br/>
5. Asset withdrawal<br/>
<br/>
Users who comply with our Terms may request the withdrawal of eligible in-game assets. We aim to process all valid withdrawal requests within 24 hours. We may delay or deny withdrawals if suspicious or abusive activity is detected.<br/>
6. Virtual currency<br/>
<br/>
Our App uses an in-game virtual currency called TON, which serves a purely entertainment purpose. Please note that this currency has no real-world value and should not be considered as money or financial instrument.<br/>
7. Randomness and fairness<br/>
<br/>
All gameplay events within the App are governed by random number generation algorithms (RNG). This ensures that each outcome is entirely random, with a roughly 50/50 chance of win or loss, offering fair and transparent gaming conditions for all users.<br/>
